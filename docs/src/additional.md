# Additional Football Analytics Resources

`NFLData.jl` is a part of the nflverse, a series of open source packages across R, Python, and Julia for football analytics research. To learn more about the nflverse, visit our website [here](https://nflverse.nflverse.com/). The nflverse is not affiliated or endorsed by the NFL.

If you have questions about using `NFLData.jl`, please join the [nflverse discord](https://discord.com/invite/5Er2FBnnQa). There is a dedicated `NFLData.jl` channel within the discord, though there are also channels for asking general questions about football analytics.

If you encounter any bugs or issues while using `NFLData.jl`, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nflverse/NFLData.jl/issues/new/choose) on GitHub. We will do our best to address any issues or bugs in a timely manner, though please be patient--the nflverse packages are free and open source software that we develop in our spare time, without any compensation, so sometimes our real jobs or personal lives may take precedence over bug fixes!
